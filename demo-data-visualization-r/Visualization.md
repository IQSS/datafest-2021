# DATA VISUALIZATION

Now that you know the basics, we're going to continue creating more simple charts using ggplot2, then 
move on to mapping. If you want more ggplot after this, IQSS and HBS collaborate on delivering a 
workshop devoted to ggplot2 each semester and the workshop materials can be accessed [here](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/Rgraphics.html).

Let's take another look at the data we'll be working with to make our first graphs:
```r
head(US_cases_long)
```

Now we'll create a line graph of covid case rates over time
```r
ggplot(US_cases_long, aes(x = date, y = cases_rate_100K)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

Now let's make a totally "gorgeous" graph (to see what we should not do):
```r
ggplot(US_cases_long, aes(x = date, y = cases_rate_100K, group=state, color=state)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

Time to break it down by state in a better way: create separate line graphs of covid cases rates 
for each state with ```facet_wrap()```.
```r
ggplot(US_cases_long, aes(x = date, y = cases_rate_100K)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(c("state"), ncol = 10, scales = "fixed") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), #because these graphs are too small to see x-axis labels
        axis.text.x=element_blank())
```

We can also look at cumulative cases. Here's a line graph of cumulative covid cases:
```r
ggplot(US_cases_long, aes(x = date, y = cases_cum_rate_100K)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

Then we can break it down by state by faceting line graphs of cumulative covid cases rates for 
each state:
```r
ggplot(US_cases_long, aes(x = date, y = cases_cum_rate_100K)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ state, scales = "fixed") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), #because these graphs are too small to see x-axis labels
      axis.text.x=element_blank())
```


# MAKING MAPS IN R

A great way to visualize spatial relationships in data is to superimpose variables onto a map. 
For some datasets, this could involve superimposing points or lines. For our state-level data, 
this will involve coloring state polygons in proportion to a variable of interest that represents 
an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within each state. Basically, we're going 
to create a familiar king of visualization: a filled-in map shaded according the severity of 
the outbreak in the last week.This kind of graph is called a "choropleth map." 

To create a choropleth map we first need to acquire shapefiles that contain spatial data about U.S.
state-level geographies.There are many different ways of doing this (check out [this mapping tutorial
in R](https://map-rfun.library.duke.edu/index.html), and [this comparison of how you can make choropleth
maps using different R packages](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/324400_69a673183ba449e9af4011b1eeb456b9.html)),
Today we'll use the tigris package to get Census Tiger shapefiles for census geographies. 
In particular, we will use the ```states()``` function to get state-level geographies, 
and coastal boundaries can be gathered with the argument ```cb = TRUE```:

Start by downloading state-level census geographies:
```r
us_state_geo <- tigris::states(class = "sf", cb = TRUE) %>%
  # rename `NAME` variable to `state`
  rename(state = NAME)
glimpse(us_state_geo)

glimpse(US_cases_long_week)
```

Next, merge weekly COVID-19 cases with spatial data:
```r
US_cases_long_week_spatial <- us_state_geo %>% 
  left_join(US_cases_long_week, by = c("state")) %>% 
  filter( state != "Alaska" & state != "Hawaii") 

glimpse(US_cases_long_week_spatial) #note week of year; we're going to filter on it in the next step. 
```
Now we're ready to make our map.
```r
US_cases_long_week_spatial %>% 
  # subset data for only latest week
  filter(week_of_year == max(week_of_year, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  # map starts here
  ggplot(aes(fill = cases_rate_100K, color = cases_rate_100K)) +
  geom_sf() + #at this point you have a map; now let's make it prettier:
  coord_sf(crs = 5070, datum = NA) + #setting datum = NA removes gridlines
  scale_fill_viridis(direction = -1, name = "Case rate\n(per 100K population)") + 
  scale_color_viridis(direction = -1, name = "Case rate\n(per 100K population)") +
  labs(title = "COVID-19 case rates for last week",
       caption = "Data Sources: Harvard Dataverse, 2020; U.S. Census Bureau, 2019")
```

# Interactive Mapping in R using Leaflet and Mapview.

Note: if you're going to do interactive visualizations, I highly recommend R Shiny. Check out 
the workshop materials from last year's datafest [here](https://github.com/hbs-rcs/datafest/tree/master/DataFest-2020/R_Shiny_Web_Apps), 
created by Ista Zahn. 

First, we set some options for the graph:
```r
mapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE, # set to FALSE to embed data directly into the HTML
               leafletWidth = 800,
               legend.pos = "bottomright")
```

Then create the map object
```r
USmap <- US_cases_long_week_spatial %>% 
  # subset data for only latest week
  filter(week_of_year == max(week_of_year, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  # map starts here
  mapview(zcol = "cases_rate_100K", layer.name = "Case rates (per 100K)")
```

Finally, print the map!
```r
USmap@map
```
